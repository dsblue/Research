Hey!Sweet Dee answers the door.                         What?                          Hey.      Hey  hmm.Mac & Dennis see a cat in Dee’s apartment.                 What the hell is this?           Oh  yeah.             Uh oh.                 And so it begins.                 What are you talking about? I got a cat  so what?                 Congratulations  Dee  you’ve begun your transformation into Crazy Cat Lady.Dennis laughs.                 I didn’t begin a transformation  I just I just got a cat ‘cause I wanted something to hang out with. I don’t have  you know  a roommate or anything. I don’t really have anyone to talk to. So I got.            If you listen to yourself  you would realize you’re only strengthening our argument.                Ok  what do you want?                I need a big bowl for popcorn.            Yeah! Mac and Dennis Movie Night! Tuesday night is Movie Night! We’re doing Predator  again.                You guys don’t have a bowl?            Uhwe don’t have a big one  no.            Not one for what we need  Dee.                Alright  be careful  come on! Are you serious?            Some cups  saucers.       Responding to Dee       Yeah.      finding the bowl           Oh! Bingo!           Nice.                Yeah  you found it!  Why did both of you have to come over here to get one bowl?            It’s more fun if we both come.                Yeah  I was going to hold the bowl  Dennis was going to stand next to me and make snide comments.            Oh yeah  that’s right. points to Dee Oh  you look like a bird. That’s one.                Nahthat one’s kind of old.  Pick a new one  you got a new one?            It’s an ‘Oldie but Goodie.’                He comes up with good ones.                Yeah  no  that was a good one.                 I don’t understand why you can’t make snide remarks and hold a bowl at the same time  though. If the two of us didn’t come together  what if one of us were to get in a jam? It would be silly not to have the other one there.        Silly Dennis?  That sounds downright dangerous.          To Dee           See  you’ll never get out of a jam because you’ve got no friends.             Well  you’re a spinster.                Mmm hmm.           A lonely spinster  with a cat.                Those are all funny. It’s funny ‘cause I feel like you guys are two co dependent losers who are so wrapped up in eachother that it’s hard to see how pathetic your lives are. It’s like you’re an old married couple.                 No Dee  we’re more like a dynamic duo.     So you don’t think that two thirty year old men who spend every waking moment together is a little bit pathetic?       We don’t spend every waking moment together. What are you  crazy?                Oh yeah  you’re right. I’m sorry.                      When was the last time you went an hour without seeing eachother?            All the time.                Everyday.            Yeah.                Without checking in?  Checkthat’she always checks in with me.            He likes to have me check it but  I mean  it’s not.                Enjoy that movie  loners.                She doesn’t know anything about friendship  dude.            No  how could she?  She doesn’t have any friends.         An old married couple.Dennis chuckles.              That’s what she called us.Mac and Dennis’s laughs cease awkwardly as they come to a realization that Dee may be right. Opening theme and introduction ~2.21   2.51Scene opens with Mac anxiously waiting for Dennis at their apartment.        Hey yo!                Yo  where have you been?            What do you mean? I was getting the movie.                Yeah  but you weren’t answering any of my calls  I’ve been  I’ve been calling you                        taps phone sort of over and over again.            I was having a conversation with the video store clerk.                Yeah  but I texted you 9 11  dude.                        That means it’s an emergency.            Yeah  I saw that.                 Yeah.            Umwhat was the emergency  Mac?                Well I couldn’t get in touch with you  dude. I almost called the police.            The police?  That’s a bit of an over reaction  I was gone for what? An hour? Dennis snickers.    Yeah  but I thought we had a deal  you know?  You would check in every once in a while and then that way  I would know that you were ok. Ok  I’m ok. I’m sorry  can we watch the movie?                       Yeah.  Great.  Sure.                   Yeah.Mac     Looks at the movie Dennis brought and reads  The Transporter 2 then he looks at Dennis.             Yeah  look man  I know you wanted to see Predator again but I feel like we’ve seen that 30 times in the last two months and thought that maybe we can mix things up. The video store clerk guy said that this movie is awesome so.   The video store clerk guy  I feel like you won’t stop talking about him  huh.            I asked him for a movie recommendation.                Yeah  hey  and you got one.            Ok  it’s really not that big of a deal.                Well  the big deal  Dennis  is that I wasn’t even consulted on the decision  ok?  And this is a big deal to me as well.  It’s also my night. Plus  Transporter 2  we haven’t seen Transporter 1 which means we’ll be completely lost.  I doubt it.                 Plus Jason Statham’s physique is nothing like the lineup in Predator.            Ok  will you stop? I don’t want to have conversations anymore about dudes' physiques  and whether they can.                Dennis  in body mass alone.            That’s what I was trying to avoid  a conversation about body mass  ok?  We’ve had that conversation five times a day for the last month because we keep watching Predator and all you talk about is Wheathers  and  and  and  and Jesse The Body Ventura  and how many pounds they can pack on.                It’s important to pack on mass.        Points to fingers as to describe a list  You’re talking about carbo loading.Dennis Interrupts I don’t want to have this conversation with you anymore.                No  you’d rather have conversations with video store clerks.            You know what  man?  If you don’t want to watch the movie with me  that’s fine.  Grabs the movie from Mac’s hand and walks away  I will watch it by myself.  God damn it.  Whoa  whoa  whoa  where is this coming from?            I have been thinking a lot about what Dee said and I do think sighs  maybe we are spending a little bit too much time together.  Well  what are you saying?   I’m saying that I feel like we’re in a little bit of a rut and  I feel like I’m notflourishing.                Well  far be it for me to  uh  keep the flower of you from flourishing but uh  I guess I’ll grab my shit and stay at Charlie’s.    Wait  don’t do that.  I feel like I’m the one who got us into this mess. Ok  so you’ll stay at Charlie’s then?            No  you should stay there nods  because you already said that you would. Also  I have more stuff  it’ll take me longer to pack and it’ll be easier.Doorbell rings.Dennis answers the door to find a police officer.            Hi  I’m responding to a Missing Person’s Report.Officer clicks pen.Dennis looks at Mac who had reported Dennis missing to the police.     I’ll pack my things.Mac leaves the room. Scene Opens with Philadelphia skyline  ~5.59.Dennis knocks on Sweet Dee’s door  she answers  and he is holding her bowl that he had  earlier  borrowed for popcorn.            Hey!Dennis enters laughing  he pokes Dee in the stomach as he invites himself in and walks toward her couch.            Hey yo!                What’s the matter with you?  What are you doing here?            I came to hang out with you.                I thought it was movie night.              Yeah  it is movie night but  uh  Mac and I are taking a little bit of a break.  I was thinking about what you were saying   you were right  I wasn’t spending enough time by myself.  I wasn’t being an independent individual.  I wasn’t flourishing.  So let’s watch the movie together  you and me.                 Yeah  I’m kind of in the middle of something with my cat right now.A cat meows.            Oh  ok  well yeah  I like cats  let’s bring him into the mix.                Uh  can’t do that  he is in the wall somewhere.            He’s in the wall?                Yeah  I think he got into the wall.  Dee is trying to locate her cat in the wall by listening to the cat's meows.            Wow  well that’s a bummer but  uh  I’m sure he’ll come out at some point.  He got himself in there  I’m sure he’ll get himself out  or  or  he won’t and he’ll die in there and you’ll have a dead cat smell for a while but listen  I’m going to help you out of that jam.  Open the windows and get some scented candles going  maybe get a big fan in here and then he’ll decompose and then everything’ll be fine.  Boom  that’s what it’s like to have a sidekick.  I helped you out of a jam.Dee dismisses Dennis as unhelpful by waving her hand at him.            In the meantime  let’s watch the movie  I want to  I want to  I just want to watch a movie   with ya.  Could we do that? Scene opens with Mac picking up trash at Charlie and Frank’s apartment  ~7.09.                Why don’t you just put your trash into a trash can?          I put it in the trash can when I’m ready to take it outside  dude.                  Yeah  but you could skip a step by first putting it into the can.            And you can shut the hell up  man.                Ok  and Jesus Christ Frank  are you cutting your toenails with a steak knife?            I suppose you have a problem with that  too.              Ack  oh!  Oh!  Botched toe  I botched that one.  Ooh  that’s a botched job  that’s bleeding. I need some trash to plug up the cut.  Charlie begins looking for a piece of trash.              Do not plug an open wound with trash.            Ooh  it’s bleeding like a sieve.              Then use your sock.Frank begins to use his sock to cover his cut.          Oh  don’t waste a good sock on a tiny little cut.  I’ll find you a candy wrapper if you give me a second.             Oh  oh  oh  wait a minute  that’s  that’s working.  Oh  it’s acting like a cut glove.           Oh  unbelievable dude  that’s a waste of a sock.               There are so many things that are going to need to change now that I’m living here.     Are you hearing this shit  bro?              Well  you know  he’s got some good ideas.            What?              Maybe it wouldn’t be bad if he moved in.            Are you serious  dude?               I could use a little structure in my life here  I mean  look at all the trash all over the place.            I love the trash.              He’s cleaning up the trash.            UhI don’t want to.Charlie reaches for the ringing phone.                Ahem  is that Dennis?            I don’t know who it is  I haven’t answered the phone.                Are you going to answer it though  because?            Unbelievable dude  I’m just going to get it.  finally answers the phone  Hello?  Dennis is on the other line  he is calling from Dee’s sofa while Dee still looks for her cat.            Hey  buddy  how’re you doing?            Oh  Mac is being annoying as shit.          Is that him?            Oh  Mac is being annoying?  sarcastically That’s a big surprise.  Is he bossing you around a whole bunch?            Totally bossing me around.            Yeah  typical  it’s what he does  it’s what he does. Did he mention me?            No.            No? Really?  He didn’t say anything  at all  about me or?            What is this  dude?  Did you call me just to talk about Mac?  Ok?  Because I don’t want to talk about Mac with you.                 Is he talking about me?            No  no  no  tell him I’m not talking about him.  Tell him I’m not talking about him at all.            I’m not telling him shit  dude.  I’m going to hang up the phone on you.            No  no  Charlie  don’t hang up the phone  no  I didn’t  I didn’t call to talk about Mac  I swear to God  dude.  Please  come on  I couldn’t care less about that guy.  Are you kidding me?  I called to talk to you.  I wanted to see if you wanted to come over to Dee’s apartment  we’re doing a movie night!      Charlie  hang up the phone.            Oh my God dude  I’ll be right over.They hang up the phone.            Yes  yeah  yes.  Yes  hey Dee  Charlie’s coming over.   I don’t care.     Yeah  shit  I don’t care either. Scene opens at Dee’s apartment ~9.17.            I am so excited to watch this movie without Mac  he is so annoying.  He’s always constantly critiquing the fight scenes and talking about how he can choreograph the fight scenes so much better than they could  which is ridiculous.  He doesn’t know shit.       Ooh  Dennis  I’ve pin pointed him.            Dee  would you forget the God damned cat for a second and listen to all the interesting things I have to say?  You’re being the worst sidekick right now.                No  you’re being the worst sidekick  I thought sidekicks were supposed to help eachother out of jams.              What? I did help you out of a jam!  I told you what to do with your dead  stinking cat.                No  no  no  no  no  come on. Oh  I lost him!  I lost him Dennis  sarcastically thanks a lot.            Oh  do me a favor.  Can you peel this apple for me  please?          No  no  I’m not going to peel an apple for you.            But Mac always does it for me.                Why does Mac peel your apples for you?              He doesn’t like for me to eat the apples with the skin on it. He says the skin’s loaded with toxins.                Ok  well good news  Mac’s not here.            Well  I know he’s not here and that’s why I need you to do it for me  please. Please.                Oh  Jesus  just eat it with the skin on it.        I do not like it with the skin  Dee!  I’m not allowed to eat it with the skin.  I’m not allowed!                Oh my God  alright  if you just shut up  I will peel the apple for you the way that Mac likes you to eat it. Give it to me  give it to me!  Dennis throws Dee the apple. I’ll do it the way that Mac insists.  Ok? Yeah. Dee walks to the kitchen and Charlie enters the apartment  ~10.30.  Hey yo!  Is that Charlie? Charlie’s in the house.  Charlie’s in the house. Stands up to greet and dance with Charlie  Hey  hey! Hey  hey  hey.  Do you want a skinless apple  Bud?               Yup.          Two skinless apples  Dee. It’s part of the movie out. It’s movie night!            Here’s your apple  dick.             Alright. Dennis sits down.        Where’s mine?                   Are you kidding me?         Hmm?                   You can peel your own apple  Charlie.Charlie makes a face.  She’s in a little bit of a mood because her cat got stuck in the wall.  Cat in the wall  eh?   Ok  now you’re talking my language. I know this game  alright  catch me up to speed here  what do we got?  Charlie begins feeling the wall with his hands.                You’re putting Cheeto™ fingers all over the wall.            Alright  let’s focus Dee.  What’s the point of entry here?                That’s the thing Charlie  I’ve been looking all around this God damned place and I can’t find one.            Alright  I’ve seen this before.  You know what happened?  I bet it flattened itself out  gestures and went right through a seam in your wall.                I don’t think there’s anything in the laws of nature that would support that.            Cats do not abide by the laws of nature  right?  You don’t know shit apparently.     Hey  we’re still going to watch the movie  right man?       Uh  ok.                I think it’s stuck in there.            No!  It is not stuck. Alright  let’s focus on what’s happening with the cat  alright? It made a conscious decision to go in your wall.       Really?            Absolutely  absolutely  it chose to be in there. It wants to be in your wall  Dee.                I’m thinking about getting some catnip  and I was going to put it.             No  no  no  don’t do that.  Don’t do that.  It’s going to know that’s a trap  Dee.  Ok  that’s going to irritate the cat  then it’s going to dig itself down further and we may never get to it.  Ok?                Are you serious?            Let’s start thinking like a cat here  alright?  You know  we?  We need another cat. That’s what we need.                What?  I’m going to crack a little hole in your wall  a tiny one  it’ll be cool.  And then I’m going to slip a second cat in with a string tied around it.  Those two will become co dependent  then I’ll rip the second cat out and the first one hopefully  hopefully  will follow.            Hey  hey  hey man  hey. I’m sorry  I don’t mean to keep bugging you but you didn’t tell me what to do.              I don’t care.            Do you want me to start it now? Do you want me to wait? I’ll wait.     Yeah  start it.            But I want to watch it with you.  I mean  I will wait.           Just start the movie man ‘cause I’m having a conversation here.    All day.        Wow.                Alright  where are we going to get this other cat?  Oh  I’ll get you another cat.  I got followed here by  like  10 cats.  Yeah  they’re starting to follow me these days.                        I  you know  I don’t want you to miss the setup.            Wow  wow. Scene opens at Charlie’s apartment  only Frank and Mac are there; Mac is cleaning Charlie’s apartment ~12.31.Frank enters.              I got everything  all the groceries  no cat food  ha ha ha.  And I bumped into that guy at the video store.                Beefcake?              Total ‘Jerk off.’         Nice.              Hey  this place is tits.           Yeah  right?              Uh huh.                Looks good.              Yeah  you did a great job.                Thank you.Frank puts an apple to his mouth.                Whoa! Frank  no! Oh  God  dude. The skin of those things is riddled with toxins.Franks spits it out.         Yeah  ow  yeah  get it out though.  Get it all out.  Whew  that was a close call.   Good save.          Hey  alright  well don’t touch me with it.  Hey  also  I cleaned out this closet.  I’m telling you  bro  we can fit a mattress in there.  You and Charlie don’t have to sleep next to eachother anymore.              Well  uh  I  I  I kind of liked the other arrangement though.  That was pretty good.                  Uh  yeah  the other arrangement was not pretty good.  It was um  it was uh  what  what’s the word I’m looking for? Mac makes Frank feel uncomfortable about Frank’s relationship with Charlie.             Crazy?               No  it’s not  not  crazy.  It’s like.             Whack a doo?               No  just stop.Frank begins peeling an apple.               Whoa  what  what  what are you doing now  dude?             What? I’m taking the toxic skin off.             Yeah  but you’re cutting it with your toe knife.             Who gives a shit?               Frank  that is disgusting.             What?  What are you talking about?               I’m throwing it out.             What? You’re throwing my toe knife out? The toe knife is gone.                      Why would you do that?               Because you were cutting your fruit with it!         What the hell’s going on here?  Look  Mac  I mean  like  I  I think the cleaning up with the throwing the trash away is good but the  the  you know  the sleeping arrangements  and the plastic  and throwing the toe knife out the window  that’s.  I’m not going to put on airs just because I’ve got company.              So  you think not eating cat food is putting on airs?            You betcha!  Look  I’ve got to take a walk  my head is swimming.              That’s fine.  Just make sure you  you know  check in  ‘cause I haven’t heard from Charlie and it is getting late.           Yeah  right.              Ok  alright  be safe. Scene opens at Dee’s apartment  Dennis is watching his movie and Charlie walks in holding a cat that’s attached to a string ~14.15.            Ok  Dee  this little lady is a Calico Cat  all Calico Cats are female.  I’m going to pop this little girl in your wall here  she’s going to meet your little fellow  they’re going to bond  and then I’m going to rip her out and he’s going to come right afterward.
