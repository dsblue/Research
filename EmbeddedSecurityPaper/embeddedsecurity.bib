@article{Sahoo2012,
abstract = {Recent technological advances in wireless communications and physiological sensing allow miniature, lightweight, ultra-low power, intelligent monitoring devices, which can be integrated into a Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) for health monitoring. Physiological signals of humans such as heartbeats, temperature and pulse can be monitored from a distant location using tiny biomedical wireless sensors. Hence, it is highly essential to combine the ubiquitous computing with mobile health technology using wireless sensors and smart phones to monitor the well-being of chronic patients such as cardiac, Parkinson and epilepsy patients. Since physiological data of a patient are highly sensitive, maintaining its confidentiality is highly essential. Hence, security is a vital research issue in mobile health (mHealth) applications, especially if a patient has an embarrassing disease. In this paper a three tier security architecture for the mHealth application is proposed, in which light weight data confidentiality and authentication protocols are proposed to maintain the privacy of a patient. Moreover, considering the energy and hardware constraints of the wireless body sensors, low complexity data confidential and authentication schemes are designed. Performance evaluation of the proposed architecture shows that they can satisfy the energy and hardware limitations of the sensors and still can maintain the secure fabrics of the wireless body sensor networks. Besides, the proposed schemes can outperform in terms of energy consumption, memory usage and computation time over standard key establishment security scheme.},

Abstract = {To facilitate the development of the dynamically partially reconfigurable system (DPRS), we propose a model-based platform-specific co-design (MPC) methodology for DPRS with hardware virtualization and preemption. For DPRS analysis and validation, a model-based verification and estimation framework is proposed to make model-driven architecture (MDA) more realistic and applicable to the DPRS design. Considering inherent characteristics of DPRS and real-time system requirements, a semi-automatic model translator converts the UML models of DPRS into timed automata models with transition urgency semantics for model checking. Furthermore, a UML-based hardware/software co-design platform (UCoP) can support the direct interaction between the UML models and the real hardware architecture. Compared to the existing estimation methods, UCoP can provide accurate and efficient platform-specific verification and estimation. We also propose a hierarchical design that consists of a hardware virtualiz},

Abstract = {The objective of this research is to integrate an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) reader into a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to authorize or keep track of people carrying RFID tags. The objective was accomplished by integrating hardware and software. The hardware consisted of two WSN nodes - the RFID node connected to one of the WSN nodes, and a computer connected to the other WSN node. For the RFID equipment, we used the SM130-EK kit, which included the RFID reader and the RFID tags; and for the WSN, we used the Synapse Network Evaluation kit, which included the two sensor nodes. The software consisted of a program module developed in Python to control the microprocessors of the nodes; and a database controlled by a simple program to manage the tag IDs of people wearing them. The WSN and RFID nodes were connected through I2C interfacing. Also, the work of sending commands to the RFID node, to make it read a tag and send it back to the computer, was accomplished by the Python c},
